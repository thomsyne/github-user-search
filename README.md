# GithubUserSearch

## Highlight something in your project that you thought was especially interesting or significant to your overall implementation.

The "Details" component that displays the list of Github users is actually the most interesting part of my implementation. The sharing of data between parent and child components using @Input and @Output decorators allowed me practice my knowledge of reusable components and data transfer.

## Tell us about what you are most pleased or proud of with your implementation.

The implementation of best practices - including lazy loading, unsubscribing from observables, application modularization are things I find pleasing in my application. However, what stands out for me is the "parent to child" and "child to parent" data sharing between the Landing and Details component. It brings to life a number of Angular practices that would be useful in standard production applications.

## Given more time, what would the next feature or improvement you would like to add to your project?

Given more time, I would upgrade the project to Angular v14 and test this implementation with "standalone components" and the new Inject function. I would also use skeleton loaders for the list items and implement a debounce on the search input.
